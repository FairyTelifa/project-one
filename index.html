        <p>
          There's about as much caffeine in G FUEL as you would find in a large
          cup of coffee (150 mg per serving). For those who are sensitive to
          caffeine, we offer a great caffeine-free alternative.

        <center><h1>FDA APPROVED?</h1></center>
        <p>
          G FUEL Energy Drink Formula is a natural supplement, not a drug.
          Unlike medications and drugs, which require approval by the Food and
          Drug Administration (FDA), dietary supplements do NOT need to be FDA
          approved. However, you can rest assured knowing G FUEL is manufactured
          in FDA certified facilities and is 100% FDA compliant. These
          facilities are inspected by and adhere to the requirements of the
          United States FDA.
