        <h1>WHAT IS G FUEL?</h1>
        <p>
          G FUEL is a Natural Energy Drink Formula created by Gamma Labs. Our
          original goal was to create a 100% clean, natural, and healthy
          alternative to sugar-loaded Energy Drinks. What we were after was an
          Energy Drink which would meet even the high standards of the most
          active and hectic lifestyles.

        <h1>CAFFEINE</h1>
        <p>
          There's about as much caffeine in G FUEL as you would find in a large
          cup of coffee (150 mg per serving). For those who are sensitive to
          caffeine, we offer a great caffeine-free alternative.

        <h1>0 SUGAR</h1>
        <p>Zero, zilch, nada â€“ there's absolutely no sugar in G FUEL.</p>

      <div class="col3">
        <h1>FDA APPROVED?</h1>
        <p>
          G FUEL Energy Drink Formula is a natural supplement, not a drug.
          Unlike medications and drugs, which require approval by the Food and
          Drug Administration (FDA), dietary supplements do NOT need to be FDA
          approved. However, you can rest assured knowing G FUEL is manufactured
          in FDA certified facilities and is 100% FDA compliant. These
          facilities are inspected by and adhere to the requirements of the
          United States FDA.
